Where as a swords blade is made to be balanced and agile, the 
axes focus more on hitting harder with a sharp blade.
The means of damaging your opponent is hacking away at them. 
In this sense there is much less finesse in your attack. 
Many variationshave been made on axes, including lengthening 
the pole, adding a second blade, adding massive weight, making 
them light enough to throw, etc..

&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of

What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 - doing something an imm told you specifically not to do
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over

Name     effectivity~
Text     Talent levels are dictated by three scales: Skill, Power, and Effectivity.
 
Your Skill in a telent is simply how many high you have Leveled that
Talent.  Anyone can level any talent to 200.
 
Without Power, however, Skill is useless.  Power is how much you have
traded in for a Talent.  This requires tradein points (tps).
 
Skill and Power combine to determine your Effectivity, which is your
refined strength.  Effectivity (Eff) regulates how strong your 
character's magic is.  While Skill does determine which spells and
abilities you have access to, certain spells and abilities require a
high Eff to use (for example, 100 motion Skill will not give you Bypass
Notravel; only if you have 100 Effectivity).

#HELP
Name     experience~
Text     Talent levels and Weapon skills are based on experience.  If you are level 1
in Time, it will take very little experience to get you to level 2.  In fact,
casting one Time spell will probably raise your level.  When you get to higher
levels, it will take considerably more experience.  Weapon skills work the
same way.  If you are level 0 in claws, and you claw someone, your claws skill
will probably go up.  When it gets to higher levels, it will take much more
to raise it.  The most common way of gaining experience is by exploring,
although you do get some exp when you fight something.
 
When first starting out, it is recommended that you gain your experience
from exploring the areas around you and moving from one place to the next.
In order to use this earned experience, try targetting yourself with some
of your abilities. To see these, type SLIST. Don't worry, even your 
offencive capabilities are not dangerous to yourself at this point, so feel
free to target them on to yourself. This is especially true of your inborn
talent.
 
Your experience is not shown, but the MUD keeps track of it.  You must simply 
estimate how close you are to gaining a level.  If you type "attributes" you
can see a verbal indicator of your exp pool.  If you are bored, you should go 
explore or fight to gain more.  If you are "brimming with inspiration" you
should have no trouble leveling when you use your skills.

Your exp goes into a large pool, and when you use skills or abilities they take
out exp and use it.  Since you gain exp by fighting or walking, quite often
your skills use up exp as fast as you can gain it.
 
If you have trouble, do not hesitate to ask for assistance from fellow players.
There is almost always someone willing to help.

Name     gith~
Text     The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.

Name     gnomes~
Text     Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can, though,
suffer tremendously from physical attacks.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with 'score'), you will not regain hitpoints, movement points
or mana back if you are starving or dehydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long, your combat skills will be affected,

asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and

manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
 
Any time you feel you have been harassed, You must do the following:
1. Make a public channel announcement, telling the offending player
to stop harassing you.  
2. If harrasment persists after one or two times, contact an Immortal.
3. If no Immortals are available, type 'time' and make a log.
4. ANY and ALL logs of this nature are to be sent to Herbman, and 
noone else.  Please make sure that it is an unedited log.  Forged

Name     magic~
Text     Syntax: magic <type> <verb> <power> <target>
 
Type indicates not only what talent is being used, but what type of
magic from that talent. Some talents may have multiple types. For
example, Earth Magic involves both nature spells and rock spells, and
different types will be used to make use of each. Each type may have
several different words to indicate it. 
 
Verb and power are interchangable, and any field may be left out to
assume a default. Some verbs automatically assume a specific talent,
and vice versa. Each verb may have several different words to indicate it.
 
Power indicates how much mana will be used on the spell. More power
power will do more damage, heal more hp, and some effects require high power
to be successful. 
 
Target may be a character, an object, or none. Effects will often vary 
greatly depending on the target. A combo might do one thing when used upon
an object, but a rather different effect when used with no target. 
The default verb is tricks. This will also be used whenever a spell fails
for many reasons. Tricks will train the talent, and display a message to
that can be useful for RP, but will have no other effect.

Text     Playerkilling is legal on this mud, so long as it is related to

Killing people is an extreme measure, and should be treated as such.
Killing outside of roleplay, for OOC reasons, is strictly forbidden.
(Comments on OOC and WARTALK are not reasons for playerkilling.)
SPAM-KILLING:
You are limited to killing a particular person once per day. This does not
mean that you can kill someone with each of your charachters once per day.
Naturally, if someone attacks you that you have killed already, you may kill
him/her again, as long as it is in self defense. (i.e. if they flee, you cannot
travel to them repeatedly and kill them)
If the person attacks you and runs away repeatedly, they forfeit this right,
and you may kill them until they leave you alone.  This is considered
defending yourself from harassment, and should be done only if no
Immortals are present to deal with the situation.

Name     roleplay_tips~
Text     This is just a compilation of rules and helpful hints on roleplay...
 
Roleplay in public areas of the mud should be open to any and all that wish to 
join in. Mudsex in public areas will not be tolerated and tp deductions will
ensue for any offenses after the first. 
 
When using emotes, they should be open-ended, allowing other characters to
react instead of predetermining that character's action. For
example, if your character throws something at someone using a typed out emote,
don't automatically determine that it hits said character.
 
Information gathered OOCly is not known by your character, unless they have
gathered it through rp.
 
Though elkandu do not die permanently, if your character has been killed 
through rp, especially repeatedly, a rename may be appropriate.
 
When rping or in a public area, use the command osay for room ooc comments.
Repeated use of the say command for ooc comments will result in tp deductions.
 
Don't forget to report your rp using the appropriate command.
 
No actions permanently affecting another character permanently cannot be 
done without getting the approval of that character's player (This 
includes roleplayed pkilling.).
 
Actual pkilling is allowed only on the plane of Mezulbryst, no consent is 
necessary in this world. PK outside of this area will be dealt with.

Most importantly, HAVE FUN!

#HELP
Name     spells~
Text     The magic system of Rogue Winds is based on TALENTS, specific disciplines
of magic.  Each talent has its own set of spells and abilities.  Although,
there is some overlap.

Your ability in a talent is measured by three variables: SKILL, POWER, and 
EFFECTIVITY.  You start the game with talent points which can be allocated 
as you see fit.  "Trading-in" talent points causes your POWER to increase.  
When you level, your skill increases.  EFFECTIVITY is calculated from comb-
ining both SKILL and POWER in that talent.  To see these variables you can 
look into any reflecting pool.  
    &G(RP TIP: The exact values of your SKILL, POWER, and EFFECTIVITY are 
    unknown 'in character'.  You should remember this before you start 
    talking about your levels; Levels DO NOT EXIST 'in character'.)&w

New spells and abilities are gained as you advance in SKILL, but the strength 

of your spells and abilities is determined by POWER (and your stats).
You may gain more talent points later from roleplaying, bug reports, or

quests, which can be used to increase the power in your talents, or to
"discover" new talents within yourself.

You must go to a cleric to practice your spells (listed under "practice").

Name     strategy~
Text     As a newbie here, you have many choices.  You can begin playing the game,
leveling your character and improving its stats.  You may also roleplay.
The imms often reward good roleplay and well written character histories.
(see also help &Yroleplay&w)
 
To begin managing your character you should choose your talents.  It is
suggested you choose talents which match both your character's race and
its roleplay, though race is less of an issue.  (see also help &Ytalents&w)
 
After choosing talents, you can level them by gaining exp and using your
abilities gained through the talents you have.  You should visit the forest
west of the Nexus and through the portal to Lezaria.  Here you can simply 
explore for exp, or you can kill the furry woodland creatures.  You should
pay very good attention to the names of mobs.  'Baby' squirrels are wimps 
compared to 'large' squirrels.  'Ancient' dragons are much tougher than 
'baby' dragons.  This adjective system replaces "consider".  
(see also help &Yexp&w)
 
It is very important that you prepare yourself when you go to fight anyone.
(see also help &Yready&w)
 
Armor is not important in Rogue Winds.  Certain races do not use armor at 
all.  Humanoid races do benefit from the protective ability of clothing.  
You may want to ask politely if someone has some spare clothing.  You can 
also fashion your own clothing from raw materials readily available from 
the mud.  (see also help &Yfashion&w)

Name     star_wyvern~
Text     A smaller breed of wyverns, star wyverns are magically enchanted wyverns.
These beings originated from a line of wyverns whose forms were altered

creatures. Star Wyverns are lined with crimson scales, have vibrant silver wing
and a long whip-like tail. They are more intelligent than regular wyverns,
and focus more on spells than combat. On the inverse of being so magical,
star wyverns tend to be weak physically, and have more frail bodies.
In the wild, they live in hidden nests high in the skies, and generally
do not venture far from their airborn living quarters. They are highly
agressive creatures and will attack anyone whom they percieve to be a threat.
Though they have not developed complete speech, they can communicate through
emitting odors from their scales. By using this, they can strike down a foe
in large groups by emitting a scent that alerts others nearby. Their name
came from the magician who created them. "Born of the sky and holding the
searing scales of fire from the heavens, they are beings destined to
conquer the stars."

Name     zovids~
Text     Dragon-like lizards with long hind legs and short, nimble forelegs,
similar to human arms. They have three fingers on each arm and three toes
on each foot, with tails and necks half the length of their body. They
have ridged head-plates and three sets of eyelids: clear, thin and ridged
They are agile creatures, and excellent runners. They have been tamed
and are often kept as pets, though there are still wild Zovid nests about.
