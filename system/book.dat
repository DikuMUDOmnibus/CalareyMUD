~
Text     Artu-luv tea is a delicious drink, but it is also a sedative.
It can help you sleep when you are having trouble, it is said,
but the glowberry can enhance this ability. A few drops of the
juice of a glowberry into your tea will transform it into a
powerful sleeping potion. Note however, that the resulting
concoction will be bright red rather than the normal reddish
brown of artu-luv tea, but it will be far more potent than
your normal cup of tea.

Chapter Four:
Great Flasks of Fire
~
Text     As you may know, the fire pepper is very spicy, but it is so
named because it has inherent Fire Magic within it. Using some
glowberries, the fire power of the peppers can be brought out.
Simply take a flask, and extract the juices of the fire pepper
into it. Then carefully drip small amounts of the juices of a
glowberry into the flask, being careful to keep your hands away
from the mouth of the flask. The glowberries will cause the
pepper to burst into flame, creating a magical flask full of
fire. Don't drink it! If you drop the flask on the ground, the
fire will spread out and create a small magical fire that you
might use for cooking or forging.

Chapter One:
Different Bows
~
Text     There are many different bows out there, and it is up to the astute
archer to weigh their pros and cons and pick one accordingly. The
smallest type of bow is the short bow. This is easy to use and
versitile, for it can be shot in close quarters and more easily
from horseback. The most common bow is the longbow, although it can
be difficult for beginners to use. An easier bow is called the
recurve bow, so named for its curved back shape. The most complex
type of bow is the compound bow, which uses pulleys to enhance the
draw of the bow, allowing even weaker or younger people to use it.

Title     Beyond the Spheres
by Retarlang Kimson

Chapter VII: Transcendancy
~
Text     When one has attained true mastery of the control of raw mana and
energy, one may attempt to transcend the physical realm. This is
extremely dangerous, and if done improperly could cause one to be
drawn into the Void and reborn immediately. To perform this act
of transcendancy, the wizard who desires it must draw their mana
to the center of their bodies. Then, as they draw upon the power
of all magic to change them, they step out of their body as an
ethereal being. As a magical ethereal, the ease of magic use is
greatly enhanced, and much safer than as a nonmagical ghost. As
well, if they so choose, they may then possess the corpse of
another being and take their form instead.

Text     Upon attaining true mastery of the powers of the unholy and dark,
one may choose to completely surrender themselves, body and soul,
to the powers of darkness. While doing so will increase one's
power greatly, particularly with dark magic, their ability to use
holy magic will be hindered, as well they will become more
vulnerable to such attacks by holy magic. However, should one
choose to perform this ritual, simply channel Unholy Magic through
your body and soul, and allow it to change you. The darkness will
then seize your soul, and leave you terrible and demonic, with
the power of pure darkness flowing through you.

Now, slide the pan into the oven and bake them on medium for

much, for it will make a mess! Now, when the cookies are done,
pull the pan out of the oven and allow them to cool. When they

Chapter One:
What is the dreamworld?
~
Text     The World of Dreams, a parellel to our own world, is best described
as a separate plane of existance. It is formed by the dreams and
thoughts of those living in the universe, and people of sufficient
talent and skill are capable of entering this world at will and
manipulating that which is within it. In the Dreamworld, one can
see and hear all that happens in the waking realms, but cannot act
or influence that realm directly. Neither can anyone who is awake
see or hear those who are asleep. Nevertheless, the Dreamworld is
a dangerous place, where one can encounter the nightmares of people
who are asleep, sometimes, and using magic may in itself be more
difficult and dangerous as well.

Chapter Two:
How do I reach the dreamworld?
~
Text     Providing you have at least minimal talent with Dream Magic, you
can access the Realm of Dreams by simply channeling Dream Magic,
and concentrating upon letting it move you. As the waking world
is swept away, you will enter the vivid world of the dream. To
leave again, simply repeat the same procedure, and the dream
will vanish, leaving you in the waking world parallel to where
you were in the dream. Some places you may note are warded against
Dream Magic, and you will find yourself unable to enter there
unless you are extremely powerful.

Text     With sufficient skill, you can bring others into the dreamworld
as well as yourself. While there, unless they, too, have some
talent in Dream Magic, they are pretty much at your mercy. To
bring them in, you must direct Dream Magic toward them and focus
upon moving them with it, and they will be drawn into the dreamworld.
If you wish to remove them from the dreamworld again, repeat this
procedure and they will be forced into the waking world. Note that
this does not force them to remain in the location you pulled them
in, they may wander off or run away afterward.

Title     Dreamworld
by Sidlavan Ehonthim

Chapter Four:
How do I manipulate the dreamworld?
~
Text     Manipulating the dreamworld takes some skill, but the simplest
method is to create items in the dreamworld. In order to do this,
just channel Dream Magic to create the object and material you
wish. More mana may be required to form larger objects, of course,
and you are not limited to merely mundane materials. Within the
dreamworld, you might forge things from mana, fire, chaos, wind,
shadow or spirit, as well as any normal material. Unfortunately,
these items are purely imaginary, and will vanish should they
leave the possession of a dreamer or if you leave the dreamworld.

Text     Can I shift into other parts of the dreamworld?
In much the same way as Motion will allow you to travel, using
Dream Magic you can shift into the dreams of others. Simply
channel Dream Magic and concentrate upon allowing it to move
you toward a remote location of your choice. This will work to
people or places just as easily. Places warded against Motion
will not keep out one shifting through the Dreamworld, however
anyplaces warded against Dream Magic will prevent it from
working.

Text     Although this is a less than kindly use of the dreamworld, it
will be covered here for completeness, as sometimes it is
necessary, primarily for fighting off hostile inhabitants of
the dreamworld. Dream Magic can be used to harm another being,
but only within the World of Dreams, as outside it will appear
not to have an effect. When you set Dream Magic to harm one,
they will experience terrible nightmares that will attack them,
becoming real within the dreamworld.

His thunder tail that lightning quick
could crush a stone like twig or stick--

could pierce a shield or mail cold--
 
His ivory fangs that rip and cut

his gaseous poisoned burning breath
set all it touched to painful death--
 
And worst of all, his blood-red eyes
that lead to fate worse than demise
for ne'er again thou'd be thine own

by Suzcecoz Ilawi

Foreword
~
Text     This book can tell of many uses of the incredible power that
is known as Void Magic. Be warned, however, to the unskilled,
Void Magic is extremely dangerous and even deadly. Even to
those who are skilled in it, it remains dangerous, and must be
used sparingly when it is used at all. Note, however, that
some uses of Void Magic may be safer than others, these will
be so noted. The author of this book takes no responsibility
for any injuries or deaths resulting from misuse of Void Magic.

Chapter One: Antimatter
~
Text     Antimatter. Easily the most desctructive substance in the
universe. It can injure people, or destroy objects, when used
to destroy. Antimatter appears as crackling black lightning,
that when it makes contact with normal matter, will destroy
both. Although thin streams of antimatter are not enough to
outright destroy objects as large as people, it can still
cause great damage and pain.

#BOOK
Name     Everything and Nothing - [2] Antimagic~
Title     Everything and Nothing:
The Wonders of Void Magic

by Suzcecoz Ilawi

Chapter Two: Antimagic
~
Text     Probably one of the most useful as well as safest uses of
Void Magic is the channeling of antimagic. In all ways the
antithesis of normal mana, antimagic can reverse, cancel, or
undo the effects of normal magic. When focused upon an item,
it can strip that item of magical effects. However, focused
upon a person, it can be used to disrupt a magical shield.
When used to change a person, it can strip them of illusions
and disguises. When used to hinder, it can dispel temporary
spells enchanted upon a person. And finally, if runes of
antimagic are drawn in a room, all other runes and magical
effects will vanish from the room, before the runes vanish.
Antimagic is even more unstable than normal magic, so it is
nearly impossible to create long lasting antimagic effects.
However, with practice and quick reflexes, one might be able
to quickly channel antimagic in order to disrupt harmful
spells being cast upon them by others.

Title     Everything and Nothing:
The Wonders of Void Magic

by Suzcecoz Ilawi

Chapter Five: Ether
~
Text     Ether is probably the most useful substance in the universe.
The most stable aspect of Void Magic, ether can be used to
conjure items from nothingness. With a little skill and
practice, these items can be refined and shaped into exactly
the form the mage desires. More power is required to construct
larger objects from ether, although they can be created much
more easily from inside the Void. However, since doing anything
inside the Void is inherently dangerous, it is generally
recommended to just shape your ether in the physical world.
Any item which you know how to create can be fashioned from
ether in this manner.

by Keliole Chelseer

Chapter One:
Recalling a Memorized Location
~
Text     The simplest use for Motion Magic, which nearly all Elkandu are
capable of utilizing, is an ability known as recall. Anyone that
has touched the Nexus can innately feel it's location in the cosmos.
Thus, you have merely to recall it's location, and move toward it.
You can also memorize other locations, and recall them at will as
well. Note that special wards may prevent the recall ability from
working properly, and the number of locations you can successfully
memorize depends upon your skill at Motion Magic.

Chapter Two:
Free Teleportation
~
Text     It takes a good deal of skill to be able to teleport directly from 
one location to another. Often, the best you will be able to do is 
to land somewhere in the general vicinity. In spite of this, it
takes only pure Motion Magic to move you from one location to
another in this manner. Simply concentrate upon the image of the
location, provided you have been there or seen it before, and call
upon the powers of Motion to travel there. Highly skilled Travellers
are capable of so travelling directly to a person or place as well.
However, Security wards upon locations may prevent teleportation
and block all but the strongest of Travellers from penetrating the
enchantments.

Text     Sending others to distant places can be accomplished in much
the same way teleporting yourself is. However, it takes a good
deal more skill as you need to know exactly where you are
sending them. Simply channel Motion Magic and concentrate on
the person or object you are meaning to send, and let the magic
send it to the person you wish it to go to. As with other such
abilities, this will not work if either your current location
or the place you wish to send it to is warded against Motion.

Text     It is also possible to use Motion Magic to pick up items on the
ground and bring them toward you. This can be very useful if you
are flying or they are just out of reach. To do this takes a
combination of Wind and Motion magic. Channel Wind Magic and wrap
it around the item and focus upon moving it toward you. Larger
and heavier objects will naturally take more mana in order to lift
them. Note that you won't be able to snatch any item that is being
carried by another person in this way, nor anything that is firmly
attached to the ground or wall.

Text     Attaining flight can be achieved in much the same way as lifting
an object, although it requires a bit more skill to achieve
successfully. To levitate, channel Wind Magic and bring it around
yourself, focusing upon moving yourself, and you will slowly lift
off the ground. You could also levitate others into the air in the
same manner, but they may not remain hovering in midair. To return
to the ground, simply repeat the process, and allow the Wind Magic
to move you.

Text     Now, when you are going to select what type of ore you will use for
a project, you should first take into mind the properties of that
ore, for different types of ore may have various different benefits
to using it. The easiest way to determine the properties of an ore
is to channel a little Earth Magic into a sample of it and seek for
its properties. This will allow you to determine how magical and
valuable it is, and any other properties it has. Magical ores may
be useful for some things, as they are easy to enchant, but one
cannot discount the usefulness of other properties as well, such as
ores which are extremely durable, or light but strong.

rare and powerful stone called luminite, so named because of its
radiant glow. Although it is rare and expensive, a small shop which
sells some luminite is tucked away in Tinemocun. If you don't wish
to spend that much, such materials as mithril and silver are also
quite good at absorbing mana. Don't bother with any lead or iron
if it is magic you are looking for. Their magical capacity is
abysmal at best, and you'd be just wasting your time and money.

such can be accomplished with a high power of Fire Magic. Simply
direct Fire Magic toward the item as if you were going to attack
with it, and channel in a good degree of power. The larger the
item you wish to melt, the more power will be needed in order to
revert it to its natural form. If you are successful, your item
will be successfully converted into raw metal once again, and
you can forge it anew.

Introduction

Text     Gems can be a powerful thing, when used as a focus for magic.
Different types of gems may help improve your ability to focus
different types of magic. For instance, the ruby will allow one
to focus fire magic with a greater effectivity. Normal gems will
not have this effect, but only rare gems which have been formed
with the assistance of magic. Merely enchanting a gem will not
allow one to focus magic through it. Regions with extremely high
concentrations of mana may naturally yield magical gems.

Title     Necromancy And You:
Bringing Back Your Dead Friends

-- Kalazas Darkstar

Chapter 1:
Preparing the Body
~
Text     Now, you have a dead friend, and wish to restore them to a state
of unlife, to serve you for eternity? Never fear, for this book
will tell you how, in a simple, easy to follow, step by step manner!
Before we begin, first you must have a corpse of the person or
creature which you wish to reanimate. Preferably this corpse is
whole, for any parts missing on it will not be regenerated upon
animation. With the corpse in hand, you should channel a little
Time Magic into the corpse to assist it, so that it should stop
decaying. Rotting corpses rarely make good servants, for they smell
and will fall apart after a short period of time.

Chapter 2:
Choices
~
Text     Before we begin, let us first examine the possibilities. With
practice, you may learn to animate a friend as one of many things
not just mere zombies. From ghouls and vampires, to fearful liches
and banshees. If an ethereal form is what you desire, few things
can top a banshee or shadow. Myself, I prefer vampires, for they
tend to not smell and are quite intelligent and durable. Each type
has their own benefits and drawbacks, so choose a type suited to
your own desires and needs.

Chapter 3:
Animating The Corpse
~
Text     Now that you've got the body prepared and the type of undead you
want in mind, it's time to begin the ritual. Some people use candles
or goats blood, while others perform various actions upon the
corpse, but these are not necessary. I prefer simply channeling the
appropriate magic in solitude in a darkened room or under starlight,
where I can concentrate properly. When you are ready to begin the
ceremony, close your eyes and focus. Channel Unholy Magic into the
corpse and focus upon changing it into what you desire. This may
take a good deal of power depending upon the type of creature you
are attempting to reanimate, so don't give up if it doesn't work
the first time. Simply channel more mana into it and try again.
If you are successful, congratulations! You now have an undead
friend all to yourself.

Jazma Flour

Text     Jazma flowers, as you may already know, are a very rare and magical
plant that can be found in the fields of Lezaria. You can identify
them by their sparkling golden petals and teardrop-shaped leaves.
To make a flour out of them, collect some of the petals and crush
them into a fine powder, and sprinkle in some yeast to allow it to
rise. Jazma acts very much like your typical calluv in baking, but
depending on what you put in it, magical properties can be achieved.

with a batch of clean, fresh worfberries, or as you wish, seedless
worfberries, or mashed up berries. Then, add another crust over the
top of the pie, and pop it in the oven. Allow it to bake for half
an hour to get the magic flowing and the crust baked, and bring out
the bubbling pie. Eating a piece of this delicious pie will send
streams of Fire Magic flowing through you, increasing your strength

by Syriel Cadby

Prologue
~
Text     The oceans waves foamed and lapped against the shores of the
island of Kolmin-Dar. Suddenly, the rhythmic sound was interrupted
by splashing and screams as a platoon of vicious shark-men erupted
from the surface. The palistelli: Sworn enemies of the island
dwarves, these vicious sharkmen would stop at nothing to disrupt
the peace of the islands the dwarves called their home. Boldly,
a brigade of dwarven soldiers rushed out to the beach to meet
their attack with axes in hand. The palistelli lunged at them with
spears and tridents, and the seas were stained red with the blood
of dwarf and shark alike. But the blood only seemed to excite
the palistelli into a blood rage, and they fought back fiercer
than before. After a long and bloody battle, they were finally
beaten back, but not before many dwarves lay unmoving in the surf.

Name     Simple Magic - [1] Conjure Rose~
Title     Simple Magic
by Kali Wycliffe
 
Chapter I:
Conjuration versus Sleight of Hand
~
Text     It is a common trick of most entertainers to create a rose from thin air,
delighting an audience with this simple feat of magic. When attempting such an 
act, the question one must ask themselves is whether or not it would be best 
accomplished by magic, when simple sleight of hand may work just as well. The 
answer to this dilemma lies within the talent of the conjurer, for although 
sleight of hand is possible without any magical training, it requires one to 
actually have a rose on them to use, and is often less impressive. Using the 
magic of nature, on the other hand, has it's own tradeoff. While marginally 
more difficult, natural magic results in a rose of the highest quality, but 
the downside to this is that such a rose will eventually wisp away unless 
magically preserved. If one is capable of preserving this rose, however, it 
can result in the perfect gift; a rose that will last forever.

by Brakis Tarson

Chapter I:
Simple Conjurations
~
Text     While the powers of the Void are incredible for creating things, do
not underestimate the abilities of other talents to conjure useful
things as well. The ability to conjure a fire with Fire Magic, or to
create a spring using Water Magic, can be extremely useful in many
situations. Be aware that each thing you create in this manner may
only be a temporary effect unless magically preserved, and the more
mana you put into its creation, the longer it may last before it
disappears into the ether again.

Chapter II:
Common Conjurations
~
Text     One of the most useful applications of conjuring magic is in the
procurement of food and water, naturally, which can mean the difference
between life and death for a mage stranded in unfamiliar territory.
The creation of water, quite obviously, involves Water Magic, but
to create food, you must channel the side of Earth Magic which deals
with rocks and soil, rather than the more common nature magic.
This will form for you a loaf of bread. Be warned that if you don't
put at least some degree of mana into the bread, that it may prove
unsuitable for eating.

Useful Conjurations

Text     Many useful things can be created by conjuring. For instance, if you
need to write something and don't have a pen, you can procure one
rather easily with a little Speech Magic. And if you need to dig
and lack a shovel, you can create one by channeling Death Magic.
Similarly can you create a ball of light with Illusion, and a globe
of darkness with Unholy Magic.

Mageblades
~
Text     Utilizing the power of raw mana to create something, you may form
a weapon of power. This is known as a mageblade. It is a blade of
energy roughly in the shape of a sword, and it can be of many
different colors and textures. Every time you may one, it is never
the same weapon twice. Like other conjurations, the mageblade will
wisp into ether and vanish after a while if not magically preserved,
but you can always create another one. Mageblades, because of their
nature, will aid in the channeling of magic somewhat when they are
being wielded, as well.

Chapter III:
Arti-Luv Tea

Text     One of the finest teas you might encounter is an exquisite
drink known as artu-luv tea. Commonly made in the regions of
western Kalor, artu-luv tea is made from the extracts of an
artu root and the juices of calluv grass. Although either
order will produce a tea, if you put in the artu root first,
a much more mellow tea will be produced. If instead you put
in the calluv juices first, a strong sedative will be created,
quite useful if you are having difficulties getting to sleep.
Artu-luv tea is most delicious and a fine drink to serve with
nutcakes or sweetbread.

Name     Theories of Magic - [2] Mana Particles~
Title     Theories of Magic
by Keoke Takhandomar

Chapter II: Mana Particles
~
Text     Mana, you see, exists in the form of particles. Some regions have
higher or lower concentrations of mana particles, that Elkandu
use to utilize their magic. Mana particles may be uncharged
(latent mana), positively charged (active mana), or negatively
charged (antimagic). Elkandu have the innate ability to channel,
which in fact involves charging and restructuring mana particles
into molecules, which in turn form the magical effects desired.
Different elements of magic have different structures of their
particles.
 
Mana is innately an unstable substance, although knowledgeable
Elkandu can produce stable magical effects as well. For the most
part, charged mana will lose its charge over time. Most mana in
the universe is uncharged mana. Some regions may exhibit high
concentrations of mana, or highly charged mana, causing wild
mana storms that can be very dangerous to attempt to channel in.

Title     Transformations
by K'saklor Braghxstiyn

Part 1:
The Art of Shapeshifting
~
Text     Changing form is probably one of the most useful aspects of the
magic of Alteration. With some practice, power, and a good deal
of skill, you can transform yourself into any shape you desire.
However, making more radical alterations may be difficult to
master, so stick to creatures of the same species at first. Now,
changing oneself is very simple. You simply have to channel the
magic of change, and allow it to change your body into the form
you desire, drawing the magic inward upon yourself and keeping
the shape you wish to achieve firmly in mind. No great amount of
mana is required for this.

Part II:

Text     While even weaker Changers are capable of changing their own form,
it takes a much stronger mage to master the art of changing others.
It takes a good deal of strength just to work the magic into their
bodies, and normally only those inborn to Changing are capable of
accomplishing this. It is generally easier to perform changing
upon a willing subject, however extremely skilled and powerful
mages have been known to be able to transform the unwilling.

Altering Your Appearance
~
Text     Aside from making major changes, you may wish to fine-tune your
appearance as you desire, which is a much easier thing to do and
does not require a lot of skill. However, accomplishing it may be
a little tricky. What you need to do is, channel magic of the
Seeking Talent to change yourself, and focus upon the part of your
body you wish to change, such as your eyes. Then concentrate upon
what color or description you wish them to become. If you've done
this correctly, your appearance will change ever so subtly.

Title     Ways of the Mind
by Sithilissilin

Chapter I:
Mental Communication
~
Text     It takes no real magic to communicate mentally with other beings.
Just connect with their mind, and think what you wish to tell them.
You can also connect briefly to send a message without establishing
a firm connection, should you wish. However establishing a stable
connection as such does help, as it allows them to respond in the
same manner, by thinking. Distance does not matter to this mental
communication.

Name     Ways of the Mind - [4] Snoop~
Title     Ways of the Mind
by Sithilissilin

Chapter IV:
Snooping Other Minds
~
Text     One of the most common uses of telepathy is for the gathering of
information. When one sends out Mind Magic to seek another, he
might establish a connection between their minds that allows him
to watch over every move of his target. If the target is shielded,
this attempt to establish a connection will be blocked. Should
the target also be skilled with Mind or Seeking, he might notice
that someone appears to be watching him, so be careful. Only one
psionicist may snoop a given target at a time. If another makes
such an attempt, the mental threads will become entangled and
both mages may lose their connection. Some unskilled mages use
this attempt to snoop the same person twice to break their mental
connection.

Text     In the Sunrise Islands, one may find weaponry that isn't used
anywhere else. While much of it is similar in design to that
used in other realms, there are some very unique things, and
that which is similar is often different in ways.

Along the same line as our swords, the Islanders boast finely
made blades called katanas. A shorter sword they also have,
called the wakizashi, and a long dagger called a tanto. These 
blades are very sharp and well-crafted. Their forging 
techniques are marvelous. Another metal weapon they use are 
throwing stars or daggers called shurikens.

Introduction
~
Text     Centuries ago, after the turmoil caused by the Elkandu Crisis began
to settle down, a group of idealistic Rezalkandu broke off from the
main group. More than caring about nonintervention, these were the
pacifistic Zenkandu. While many of those called Zenkandu holed away
in remote parts of the universe as hermits, a number of them banded
together for the purposes of meditation upon the nature of the
universe and the study of magic. Focusing primarily upon knowledge
and philosophy, the Zenkandu are a group all their own.
