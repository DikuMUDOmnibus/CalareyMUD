Name		Fire~
Description	&z&gAlignment:&G evil
While a common force in everyday life, Fire holds little sway over
the world. Only rarely is its power released in great quantity, but
it is devastating when it can be accomplished. The disciples of Fire
are protected by this powerful deity and tend to stay to the warmer
climates, uncomfortable without sufficient heat.
