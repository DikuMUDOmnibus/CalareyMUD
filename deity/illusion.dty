Description	&z&gAlignment&G: chaotic
Shadow is a dark deity that thrills in malice and cold killing.  Unlike
Chaos, Shadow encourages its followers to calculate their killings
carefully, rather than barge into a situation unthinking.  Shadow's
followers are capable of slinking in even the faintest shadow unseen,
and have been granted a tolerance to many kinds of venoms and poisons.
However, Shadow worshippers have been known to fear bright light.
